				<h2>Undergraduate Teaching Assistant</h2>
				<p><b>January 2020 - May 2022</b></p>
				<p>
					As an undergraduate TA for the University of Maryland, College Park, I
					assisted with a course called ENEE150 - "Intermediate Programming
					Concepts for Engineers" for five consecutive semesters. This course focused
					on C programming concepting including pointers, memory management,
					multithreading, recursion, polymorphism, encapsulation, and best practices. 
					My duties included teaching a weekly recitation section, holding office
					hours for students, grading, and running exam review sessions. I graded
					exams and assignments and participated in both preparing exam questions and
					proctoring exams. Each week I organized and planned my recitation curriculum
					and met with the professor and other TAs to manage grading and course pacing.
					I created and maintained a personal website to provide resources for the
					class and updated it on a weekly basis with lecture notes, videos, and code
					samples. During the Covid lockdown I recorded my lectures and posted them for
					students to view as able.
				</p>
				<h2>Teaching Ambassador</h2>
				<p><b>May 2019 - February 2021</b></p>
				<p><b><i>Summer Camps and Afterschool Workshops</i></b><br>
					During the summer of 2019 I worked for the Iribe Initiative for Inclusion
					and Diversity in computing. For K-12 students, I created curriculum and
					projects for summer camps covering a variety of topics. One program focused
					on wearable technology and utilized Arduino, microcontrollers, embedded
					circuits, art, and sewing. Other camp programs covered Python programming
					website development (utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), and computer
					science topics incorporating data encryption, error detection, programming
					practices, and cybersecurity. At the conclusion of the summer started
					leading and assisting with outreach events and workshops on the University
					of Maryland, College Park campus. I began participating in the following
					programs. All programs were managed by the Iribe Initiative.
				</p>
				<p><b><i>Elementary School Programs</i></b><br>
					As a part of the weekly afterschool "Creative Computing" program, I taught
					computer science concepts to elementary school students. My team and I 
					developed curriculum for Scratch projects, cypher games, and Python turtle
					art activities.
				</p>
				<p><b><i>Girl Scout Workshops</i></b><br>
					During the Covid lockdown I continued to participate in youth education by
					teaching online. I developed original curriculum for Girl Scout Workshops
					so the girls could earn badges in computer science and cybersecurity from
					home. Curriculum included creative activities, exercises, and stories to
					instill the knowledge of safe practices with technology and the internet.
