				<h2>Embedded Firmware and Software Engineer</h2>
				<p><b>May 2022 - Present</b></p>
				<p><b><i>Work</i></b><br>
					As an Embedded Firmware and Software Engineer at Jacobs Solutions Inc.
					I primarily develop applications for software defined radios (SDR) and
					communication systems. My specializations include microcontroller
					firmware, FPGAs, test automation, and UI development. My technical skills
					include C and C++, Python, Linux, Vivado, Libero, GNU Radio, and Matlab.
					I also work with circuits, lab equipment, and UI application development.
				</p>
				<p><b><i>Mentorship</i></b><br>
					After transitioning from an intern to an engineer, I had the opportunity
					to assist with mentoring the following interns. As a mentor I assist
					interns during their onboarding process by answering questions and
					providing resources. I often work on the same or similar projects to be
					able to review their work and provide feedback and support. I also
					participate in the recruiting process by conducting phone screenings,
					interviews, and career fair visits for potential interns and new hires.
					Being a mentor has been a humbling and enriching experience as I am able
					to give others the support I had and encourage them in their career paths.
				</p>
				<h2>Electrical and Computer Engineering Intern</h2>
				<p><b>May 2020 - May 2022</b></p>
				<p>As an intern at Jacobs, I had the opportunity to apply and refine skills
					I obtained in my undergraduate courses, other internships, and personal
					projects. I created firmware for microcontrollers and VHDL programs for
					FPGAs to manage RTOS, various peripherals, and external devices. Examples
					of these peripherals included UART, I2C, SCPI, CAN, and GPIOs. I also
					developed automated tests with Python and explored PCB schematic and
					layout design with the Altium toolset.
