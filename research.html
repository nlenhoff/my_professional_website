				<h2>Graduate Student</h2>
				<p><b>August 2023 - Present</b></p>
				<p>
					As a graduate student at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County I
					am taking a course to improve my research skills and prepare for my
					Masters dissertation. I am working on a guided research project, which
					focuses on Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) and Simultaneous Localization
					and Mapping (SLAM) implemented by sensor fusion and microelectronics.
					These are my primary areas of interest and my subsequent research will
					be on related topics.
				</p>
				<h2>Undergraduate Research Assistant</h2>
				<p><b>August 2021 - May 2022</b></p>
				<p>
					As an undergraduate research assistant, I worked on an ongoing research
					project run by the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the
					University of Maryland, College Park and partnered with CoolCAD, an
					electronics company focused on the design and production of semiconductor
					Silicon Carbide. The research was sponsored by DARPA to design a
					microprocessor with a low transistor count to endure harsh environments.
					I furthered the development by writing Verilog code for the
					microprocessor. My design work solidified the instruction set and
					finalized the state machine. During the implementation phase I debugged
					the existing codebase, implemented my designs, and created testbench
					simulations to prove out the instruction set and state machine. Finally,
					I ran the design on a Xilinx Artix FPGA and confirmed that the output
					data matched the testbench outputs when identical inputs were received.
					At the conclusion of my assistantship I presented my work to
					representatives from UMD and CoolCAD, and passed the project resources
					down to the next research assistant.
